## Summary

This project implements a real-time inventory management system using RFID, IoT, and AWS cloud services to address challenges in the South African retail supply chain (Pick n Pay branches). It improves inventory accuracy, reduces stockouts, and meets local compliance regulations such as ICASA, NRCS, and POPIA.

            'expiry_date': expiry_date,
            'location': location
        })

            }
        }
    }
    response = requests.post("https://sap.example.com/idoc", json=idoc_payload)

```

## CloudWatch Metrics & Monitoring

Metrics monitored:

* IoT throughput (RFID scans/sec)
* Lambda latency (< 200 ms)
* Error rate (< 1%)
* MQTT subscription success

Alerts are triggered if performance thresholds are breached.

| ROI Payback Period      | \~12â€“14 months     | \~18â€“24 months    |

## Compliance & Risk Handling

* **ICASA:** RFID hardware certified (\~ZAR 15kâ€“30k).
* **POPIA:** AES-256 encryption, IAM least privilege, audit logs.
* **NRCS:** Hardware safety tested (ZAR 90kâ€“360k).
